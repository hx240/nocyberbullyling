      you have made it clear that you are not interested, don't want to be
      contacted by someone or have simply ignored their messages. But this
      person doesn't take no for an answer and keeps sending messages or trying
      to contact you.

      <p>
        You have unfriended or unfollowed someone or have not accepted their
        requests, so they try to get inside your social network to monitor your
        social life and check where you are and what you are doing.

        <p>
          Someone you know, such as a partner or ex-partner, constantly posts or
          sends messages that are harassing, threatening or demanding, such as
          ‘What are you doing?’, ‘Who are you with?’, ‘Where are you?’, 'If you
          don't get home soon I'm coming to find you.' They may also start
          contacting friends or family to check up on you.
