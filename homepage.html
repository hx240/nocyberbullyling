    <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is Cyberstalking?</h3>
    <p>
        According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberstalking">Wikipedia</a>, Cyberstalking is a <b>technologically-based "attack" on one person who has been targeted specifically for that attack for reasons of anger, revenge or control</b>. Cyberstalking can take many forms, including: harassment, embarrassment and humiliation of the victim. Cyberstalking can cause a wide range of physical and emotional consequences for those who are targeted.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Examples of Cyberstalking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hacking into or hijacking the target's online accounts</li>
        <li>Releasing confidential information online</li>
        <li>Tracking the target's online movements by installing tracking devices</li>
        <li>Posting or distributing real or fake photos of the target</li>
        <li>Hacking into the target's camera on their laptop or smartphone as a way to secretly record them</li>
        <li>Attempting to extort sex or explicit photos</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">How do we prevent Cyberstalking?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have <b>strong passwords</b> for all your online accounts as well as strong passwords for your devices and remember to set a reminder on your phone to regularly change your passwords.</li>
        <li>Use <b>caution on public wifi</b> by refraining from using public wifi or invest in VPN.</li>
        <li>Practice <b>online safety habits</b>, make it a priority to only accept friend requests from people you know and keep your posts private.</li>
        <li>Leave the optional sections, like your date of birth or your hometown, blank.</li>
        <li>Consider <b>disabling the geolocation settings</b> in photos, also refrain from posting your location in real time and instead post photos showing where you have been after the fact.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">How do we deal with Online Stalkers?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Respond only once to the person cyberstalking you, tell them to stop contacting you and make sure you <b>block the person cyberstalking you</b> from all your accounts.</li>
        <li>Consider <b>suspending online accounts</b>. If you are not active online, it's harder for the person cyberstalking you to reach you.</li>
        <li>You should have your devices checked out by a professional to ensure the person harassing you did not install tracking devices or hack your computer in some way.</li>
        <li><b>Keep copies of everything</b> the person cyberstalking you has sent. Make a copy for yourself and a copy for law enforcement.</li>
        <li>Lastly, please <b>notify your local police and file an official complaint</b> if you're being cyberstalked. Even if they cannot do anything right away, having an official complaint on file is important if the behavior persists or escalates.</li>
    </ol>
